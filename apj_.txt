<h2 id="C1">Early life</h2>
<p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 to a Tamil Muslim family in 
the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. 
His father Jainulabdeen was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.</p>

<h2 id="C2">Education</h2>
<p>After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, 
Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli,
 then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in 1954.
 He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.</p>

<h2 id="C3">Career as Scientist</h2>
<p>After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical
 Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information
 Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS).
In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's
 first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980

On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time, expressed that they would nominate Kalam for the post of President,and both the Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist Congress Party backed his candidacy.

he collapsed.He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse
 or any other signs of life.Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden 
cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m IST.
 His last words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: "Funny guy! Are you doing well?"</p>
